  <h2> Introduction </h2> 
  <p> I'm a high school social studies teacher at Baltimore City College in Baltimore, MD.  I'm currently in my 5th year teaching and I absolutely love it.  Naturally, I have a strong desire to learn new things and recently have garnered strong interest in web design and coding.
  <p> I'm very passionate about education and building a better future. </p>
